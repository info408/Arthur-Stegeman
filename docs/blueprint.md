## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Royal Blue (#101474) provides a sense of trust, reliability, and professionalism, fitting for legal and business documents.
- Background color: Platinum (#EFEFEF) serves as a neutral and clean backdrop that allows for ease of reading and minimizes distractions.
- Accent color: Lime Green (#70EB93) is used sparingly to highlight key interactive elements and calls to action, injecting a bit of modern energy into the interface.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif, for headers. Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, for the body of the document. Poppins brings a contemporary look, and PT Sans will make the main text easier to read.
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent different contract sections, document types, and actions.
- Employ a clean, well-structured layout that guides the user through the contract creation and review process, making efficient use of whitespace.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience during form submissions and contract generation.
